ATTENTION: If you compile and run this project, be sure to use the "-lpthread" option. Therefore, compiling would require the command "g++ main.cpp -o main.o -lpthread".

This project was developed in an Ubuntu-based Linux environment. The thread scheduling policy used is specific to Linux, and thus, this code cannot run on a non-Linux operating system.
