ATTENTION: If you compile and run this project, be sure to use the "-lpthread" option when compiling and the use "sudo" when running the executable. Therefore, compiling would require the command "g++ main.cpp -o main.o -lpthread" and running the executable requires the command "sudo ./main.o".

This project was developed in an Ubuntu-based Linux environment. The thread scheduling policy used is specific to Linux, and thus, this code cannot run on a non-Linux operating system.
